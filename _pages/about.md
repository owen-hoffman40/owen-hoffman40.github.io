    - **Lacrosse**: I start for [Swarthmore Men's Lacrosse](https://swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/mens-lacrosse/roster/owen--hoffman/13453), and I’m a longtime fan of [UNC Men's Lacrosse.](https://goheels.com/sports/mens-lacrosse)
    - **Food**: I’m always on the hunt for a great new restaurant, send recommendations.
    - **Skiing**: I grew up ski racing, so I’m happiest when I can get back on the slopes.

I am a senior at Swarthmore College completing dual degrees in Computer Science and Engineering, with research focused on human-centered safety in artificial intelligence systems. In the Collective Resilience Lab, I investigate LLM-based interventions for online safety, resulting in a first-author publication at CHI '26 on conversational agents for scam prevention education. My research objective is to bridge insights from human-centered HCI safety into embodied autonomous systems, particularly focusing on perception-conditioned decision making for robots that operate alongside people in unstructured environments.

**Research Interests:** Human–robot interaction, safe autonomy, perception-conditioned decision making, learning-based control, and human-centered evaluation methodologies for embodied AI systems.

**Current Research:** Research Assistant, Collective Resilience Lab ([Prof. Sukrit Venkatagiri](https://www.sukritv.com/)); developing and evaluating safety-focused LLM systems with applications to conversational user interfaces and online harm prevention.

**Technical Background:**
- First-author publication at CHI '26 on LLM-based conversational agents for scam prevention
- Robotics systems experience: perception pipelines, autonomous navigation, and feedback control (TurtleBot2)
- Coursework foundation in robotics, computer vision, machine learning, control systems, and digital signal processing

Hi, I am Owen Hoffman. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
