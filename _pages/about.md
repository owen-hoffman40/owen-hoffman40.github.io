Hi, I am senior at Swarthmore College studying Computer Science and Engineering. My research is focused on human-centered safety in HCI, including work in the Collective Resilience Lab on LLM-based interventions to help users recognize and respond to online scams (CHI ’26). I’m interested in bridging human-centered safety from my HCI research into embodied autonomy, with a focus on perception-conditioned decision making for robots operating around people.

**Interests:** Human–robot interaction, safe autonomy, perception-conditioned decision making, learning-based control, and human-centered evaluation.

**Currently:** Research Assistant in Swarthmore’s Collective Resilience Lab ([Prof. Sukrit Venkatagiri](https://www.sukritv.com/)); building and evaluating safety-focused LLM systems.

**Highlights:**
- First-author CHI ’26 paper on LLM-based scam prevention education
- Robotics experience in perception + navigation + control (TurtleBot2)
- Engineering + CS background with coursework in robotics, CV, ML, and DSP

Hi, I am Owen Hoffman. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
