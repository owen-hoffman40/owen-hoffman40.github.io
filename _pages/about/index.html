In the Collective Resilience Lab, I investigate LLM-based interventions for online safety, resulting in a first-author publication at CHI ‘26 on conversational agents for scam prevention education. My research objective is to bridge insights from human-centered HCI safety into embodied autonomous systems, particularly focusing on perception-conditioned decision making for robots that operate alongside people in unstructured environments.</p> <p><strong>Research Interests:</strong> Human–robot interaction, safe autonomy, perception-conditioned decision making, learning-based control, and human-centered evaluation methodologies for embodied AI systems.</p> <p><strong>Current Research:</strong> Research Assistant, Collective Resilience Lab (<a href="https://www.sukritv.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Sukrit Venkatagiri</a>); developing and evaluating safety-focused LLM systems with applications to conversational user interfaces and online harm prevention.</p> <p><strong>Technical Background:</strong></p> <ul> <li>First-author publication at CHI ‘26 on LLM-based conversational agents for scam prevention</li> <li>Robotics systems experience: perception pipelines, autonomous navigation, and feedback control (TurtleBot2)</li> <li>Coursework foundation in robotics, computer vision, machine learning, control systems, and digital signal processing</li> </ul> </body></html>
